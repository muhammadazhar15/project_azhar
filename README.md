* This project is research to design new robot localization system for [IRIS ITS](https://iris.its.ac.id/) robots
* This localization system combines Odometry and Particle Filter through sensor fusion method
* Odometry uses 2 encoder sensors and a gyro sensor to sense robot displacement
* Particle Filter use omnivision as visual sensor to detect white line in the soccer field through image processing
* For more complete explanation about this research, you can check [this](Project1-robot_localization/Paper)

> **This is my early research particle filter with python**

> * The red line is the localization data generated by sensor fusion
> * This video compare sensor fusion data with original robot location in the soccer field

* This research conducted to give [IRIS ITS](https://iris.its.ac.id/) soccer robots some orders through human voice
* There are 2 main processes in this voice recognition system, record and recognition
* This research use CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to recognize commands from human voice
* There are 7 commands that can be recognized ['Corner', 'Dropball', 'Goalkick', 'Kalibrasi', 'Kickoff', 'Stop', 'Tendang']
* In this research MFCC is used as feature extraction method to process data from human voice
* Data that used in CNN training process comes from 5 different people and 9 different people for test
* For more complete explanation about this research, you can check [this](Project2-voice_command/Paper)

> **Those are some visualization data from voice signal data and MFCC feature extraction results**

</div>

* Research project while teaching at [MA Darussalam Jombang](https://emispendis.kemenag.go.id/dashboard/?content=madrasah&action=lbg&nss=131235170053)
* Introducing AI (Artificial Intelligence) to Madrasah students, especially about Neural Networks
* This research was conducted with students to prepare for participate in [LKIR LIPI](https://kompetisi.brin.go.id/tentang/lkir) 2021
* Heart Disease Detection System is designed to detect disease through health status and heart sounds
* Health status data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) and heart sound data comes from [here](http://www.peterjbentley.com/heartchallenge/)
* The Heart Disease Detection System is applied in the website
* For more complete explanation about this research, you can check [this](Project3-heart_disease_detector/Paper)
